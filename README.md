# Colored Markers - A Simple HTML & CSS Example
This project demonstrates basic HTML and CSS code to create colored markers with a subtle 3D effect.

## Project Structure
index.html: This file contains the HTML structure of the page, including the colored markers.
styles.css: This file defines the CSS styles that control the appearance of the markers.
Understanding the Code

## HTML (index.html):
The HTML code defines the basic structure of the web page, including headings and container elements. It uses classes to reference the CSS styles for each marker element.

## CSS (styles.css):
The CSS code defines the styles for various elements:
* h1: Styles the main heading to be centered.
* .container: Sets the background color and padding for the container that holds the markers.
* .marker: Defines the size and positioning of each marker element.
* .cap and .sleeve: Styles the individual parts of the marker (cap and sleeve) with their dimensions and display properties.
* .red, .green, and .blue: These classes define the specific colors and shadow effects for each colored marker using linear gradients and box-shadow properties.

## Learning Objectives
This example can help you learn basic concepts of HTML and CSS:
Creating a simple web page structure with HTML.
Applying CSS styles to target elements.
Using classes to group similar styles.
Implementing background gradients and shadows for visual effects.
This is a basic example. Feel free to explore further and customize the appearance of the markers by modifying the CSS properties.
